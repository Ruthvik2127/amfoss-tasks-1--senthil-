## 0. Install Ubuntu 20.04

I will tell one of the major error I faced whiile installing Ubuntu.
In bios, in Advanced Option tab, under SATA Operation, there will be two modes:
  
   * RAID
   * AHCI

By default while using Windows it will be in RAID mode, and RAID mode doesnt work for Ubuntu. 

While switiching to Ubuntu, everytime I have to go to bios, change the RAID mode to AHCI mode, and back to RAID mode when coming back to Windows.

I think this SATA Operation is associated with some SSD related things, may be writing/reading SSD. Iam not sure about it. 

But one thing I know is RAID mode is some advanced option, which this Ubuntu does not support.
