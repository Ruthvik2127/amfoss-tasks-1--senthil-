## 10. CS50
I have completed pset 1 and 2. But the CS50 lectures link is currently not opening.

Since Iam not comfortaable with CS50 IDE, I used a normal online C compiler for writing the codes.
I think the main aim will be to write code and understand the logic.

I was in bi0s tryouts and there I already wrote program for Caesar Cipher and Vigenere Cipher, so it was easy for me here to complete this.
